In the file readme.md, write a description and/or make a sketch of the drawing you want to try to make.
Answer these questions:

Roughly, what will your drawing look like


My drawing will be a repeating pattern from a randomly generated polygon (triangle - hexagon) that eventually fills up the page or if time allows for it, a shape generator that will continue to repeat that shape until a specified area of pixels is filled.

What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?


One of the variables could be the number of loops the second could be the distance moved forward

Where is there repetition in your drawing?


Each sequence (new shape) represents repetition.

What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?


The shape that was generated, and yes there are clear sections which are the shapes.

How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
Perhaps a user interface section where each pentagon segment is  a little bit different.
